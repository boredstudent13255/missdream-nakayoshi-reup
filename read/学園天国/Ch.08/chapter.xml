Hi! Seeing as you're reading this, I suppose you've noticed that I've uploaded XML for raws to this Hitomi series.

Maybe I've got ahead of myself? But I figured I'd make XML entries here for some stuff on the Nakano Yayoi Archive, should I come into the posession of it. This stuff's not gonna be referenced on the site.

Actually, full disclosure, it's since I have April 1991 on the way, as is listed on the site. Figured I'd write XML for chapter 8 so that when I scan it I can implement the raws into the reader. And since I was already doing that, I decided to go right ahead and add other entries for titles I want to eventually cover.

Note by the way: That's not gonna arrive for a while yet. I was going to ship it by econ air since...tarrifs...but I couldn't select it and the other options were too expensive. It'll be here in a few momths.
