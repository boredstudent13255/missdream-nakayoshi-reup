This is a host for an interface to my Internet Archive upload of Miss Dream's... you know which page.

Please feel free to contribute to the chapter cover preview images. The format is as follows:

JPEG, 600px vertical, 70% quality
/issues/[Issue ID]/[images]

The chosen issue's ID can be found by grabbing the query string from the its page, as linked on the main pages.

The images are simply stored in order of appearance in the issue, numbered 01 to 24. If a cover is missing, please insert some kind of placeholder.
I have included a template file for creating a placeholder, but anything that's obviously not original will do.
